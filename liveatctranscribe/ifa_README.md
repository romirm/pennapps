# Informed Fast ATC Transcriber (IFA) - Implementation Vision

## üéØ Core Mission

Create validation dataset for AI ATC agent by correlating live ATC transcriptions with real-time aircraft states at JFK airport.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

### Timing Correlation Strategy

- **Simplified Approach**: Fetch aircraft data when speech segment processing completes
- **Rationale**: API data reflects current state closely aligned with radio chatter timing
- **No Lag Compensation**: API calls synchronous with transcription completion
- **Key Insight**: Real ATC commands refer to current aircraft positions, not future states

### Data Collection Scope

- **Primary Focus**: All aircraft on ground at JFK (category: "ground")
- **Expansion Ready**: Comments indicate how to include approach/departure aircraft
- **Airport Specificity**: JFK-centric with runway/taxiway/gate knowledge
- **Validation Purpose**: State S1 ‚Üí Action Y mapping for AI agent training

### Dataset Structure

- **Format**: JSON files (t1-<timestamp>.json, t2-<timestamp>.json, ...)
- **Batch Size**: 100 validation records per file
- **Record Structure**: {timestamp, aircraft_states, atc_command, command_type, affected_aircraft}
- **Metadata**: Processing confidence, correlation quality, JFK-specific context

## üöÄ Implementation Principles

### 1. Transcription Enhancement

- **Base System**: Leverage fastatc_transcriber.py proven architecture
- **JFK Context**: Enhanced system prompts with JFK runway/taxiway/gate information
- **Command Parsing**: Structured extraction of callsigns, actions, locations
- **Quality Control**: Confidence scoring and unclear transcription handling

### 2. Aircraft State Integration

- **Data Source**: client.py PlaneMonitor system (ADS-B via adsb.lol)
- **Update Frequency**: Synchronized with transcription completion events
- **State Snapshot**: Complete JFK ground aircraft positions at command time
- **Future Expansion**: Comments for including airborne aircraft filters

### 3. Command Categorization

- **Types**: taxi, takeoff, landing, frequency_change, hold, runway_crossing, altitude, speed, acknowledgment
- **Parsing**: Extract callsigns, frequencies, runways, taxiways from transcriptions
- **Filtering**: Log ignored communications (pure acknowledgments, weather, coordination)
- **JFK Specificity**: Enhanced with JFK runway/taxiway/gate knowledge

### 4. JFK Enhancement Features

- **Runway Occupancy**: Track which aircraft occupy which runways
- **Gate Assignment**: Monitor aircraft at gates vs taxiing
- **Hot Spot Monitoring**: Complex intersection awareness
- **Departure/Arrival Queues**: Sequential aircraft flow modeling
- **Weather Integration**: Future capability for weather impact correlation

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **InformedATCTranscriber**: Main orchestrator class
2. **JFKContextualTranscriber**: Enhanced FastATCTranscriber with JFK knowledge
3. **AircraftStateManager**: Synchronized aircraft data collection
4. **ValidationDatasetBuilder**: Structured record creation and file management
5. **ATCCommandParser**: Command categorization and extraction

### Data Flow

1. Audio capture ‚Üí Speech transcription (enhanced with JFK context)
2. Transcription completion ‚Üí Aircraft state API call
3. Command parsing ‚Üí Aircraft state correlation
4. Validation record creation ‚Üí JSON dataset file
5. Batch management ‚Üí File rotation every 100 records

### Expansion Points

- Aircraft filter expansion (ground ‚Üí approach ‚Üí departure)
- Multi-airport support (JFK ‚Üí LGA, EWR, etc.)
- Real-time AI agent testing integration
- Advanced weather/traffic correlation

## üéØ Success Metrics

- **Dataset Quality**: Clear command-state correlations for AI training
- **JFK Specificity**: Accurate runway/taxiway/gate context in all records
- **Processing Reliability**: Minimal data loss, high transcription confidence
- **AI Agent Readiness**: Structured format compatible with LLM training

## üö® Critical Notes for Future Development

- **Maintain JFK Focus**: All enhancements should prioritize JFK operational accuracy
- **Preserve Timing Logic**: API calls synchronized with transcription completion
- **Dataset Integrity**: Each record must contain complete state snapshot
- **Expansion Readiness**: Code structure supports multi-airport scaling
- **AI Agent Compatibility**: Dataset format must remain LLM-friendly

## üîÑ Development Iterations

1. **Phase 1**: Basic ground aircraft + transcription correlation
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced JFK context and command parsing
3. **Phase 3**: Approach/departure aircraft integration
4. **Phase 4**: Multi-airport and weather correlation
5. **Phase 5**: Real-time AI agent validation testing
