=== Bottleneck Prediction - 2025-09-20T22:03:10.341122 ===
Airport: JFK
Method: simple
Bottleneck Likelihood: 75.0%
Risk Level: High
Traffic Analysis:
  - Total Aircraft: 28
  - Ground: 21
  - Low Altitude: 7
  - High Altitude: 0
  - Density Score: 100.0/100
  - Hotspots: 5
Recommendations:
  - Consider implementing ground stop procedures
  - Increase spacing between departing aircraft
  - Monitor taxiway congestion closely
  - Prepare for potential delays
  - High ground traffic - consider taxiway optimization
