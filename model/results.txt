TRAFFIC ANALYSIS METRICS
----------------------------------------
- Total Aircraft: 10
- Ground Aircraft: 9 (90%)
- Airborne Aircraft: 1 (10%)

- Hotspots Detected: 5
- Congestion Areas: 8
- Average Distance Between Aircraft: 0.8 km
- Closest Aircraft Separation: 0.3 km

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (Following inference.py format)
----------------------------------------
Based on the critical severity (5/5) and 60-minute duration, immediate action required:

1. IMMEDIATE RUNWAY PRIORITIZATION
   - Clear runway for JBU101 (airborne aircraft)
   - Redirect ground aircraft to alternative taxiways
   - Expected outcome: Prevent airborne delays, save $2,000/hour

2. GROUND TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT
   - Implement ground stop for 30 minutes
   - Re-route aircraft to less congested areas
   - Expected outcome: Reduce ground congestion by 70%

3. AIRLINE COORDINATION
   - Contact Delta, United, American, JetBlue, Southwest, Alaska
   - Implement departure delays to prevent further congestion
   - Expected outcome: Prevent cascade delays
